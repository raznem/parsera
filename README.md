Lightweight Python library for scraping websites with LLMs. 
You can test it on [Parsera website](https://parsera.org).

## Why Parsera?
Because it's simple and lightweight. With interface as simple as:
```python
scraper = Parsera()
result = scraper.run(url=url, elements=elements)
```

## Installation

```shell
pip install parsera
playwright install
```

## Documentation

Check out [documentation](https://docs.parsera.org) to learn more about other features, like running custom models and playwright scripts.

## Basic usage

First, set up `PARSERA_API_KEY` env variable (If you want to run custom LLM see [Custom Models](https://docs.parsera.org/features/custom-models/)).
You can do this from python with:
```python
import os

os.environ["PARSERA_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_PARSERA_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Next, you can run a basic version:
```python
from parsera import Parsera

url = "https://news.ycombinator.com/"
elements = {
    "Title": "News title",
    "Points": "Number of points",
    "Comments": "Number of comments",
}

scraper = Parsera()
result = scraper.run(url=url, elements=elements)
```

`result` variable will contain a json with a list of records:
```json
[
   {
      "Title":"Hacking the largest airline and hotel rewards platform (2023)",
      "Points":"104",
      "Comments":"24"
   },
    ...
]
```

There is also `arun` async method available:
```python
result = await scrapper.arun(url=url, elements=elements)
```

## Running with Jupyter Notebook:
Either place this code at the beginning of your notebook:
```python
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
```

Or instead of calling `run` method use async `arun`.

## Running with CLI

Before you run `Parsera` as command line tool don't forget to put your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to env variables or `.env` file

### Usage

You can configure elements to parse using `JSON string` or `FILE`.
Optionally, you can provide `FILE` to write output and amount of `SCROLLS`, that you want to do on the page

```sh
python -m parsera.main URL {--scheme '{"title":"h1"}' | --file FILENAME} [--scrolls SCROLLS] [--output FILENAME]
```

## Running in Docker

In case of issues with your local environment you can run Parsera with Docker, [see documentation](https://docs.parsera.org/features/docker/).
